# MediRemedy Chatbot - Generative AI

The End-to-End Medical Chatbot Generative AI Project involved building a sophisticated conversational agent capable of delivering medical information and guidance using a combination of cutting-edge technologies. At its core, the chatbot utilized Google Gemini LLM (Large Language Model), integrated through Langchain, to enable advanced natural language understanding and generation capabilities. The project implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, combining generative AI with a retrieval system to provide accurate, contextually relevant answers. Pinecone.ai served as the vector database, facilitating fast and precise retrieval of relevant medical documents through semantic search. The front-end was built using HTML and CSS, offering a clean, intuitive user interface, while the back-end was developed using Flask, which acted as a bridge between the user interface, LLM, and database. The Flask server also handled API requests, user authentication, and session management, ensuring a smooth and secure user experience.

The deployment pipeline utilized Docker for containerization, enabling consistent application performance across different environments. The project leveraged AWS EC2 instances for hosting the chatbot, providing scalability and reliability. The AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) service was used to securely manage access to AWS resources, ensuring security best practices. The Docker images were stored and managed in AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry), facilitating seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines managed through GitHub Actions. The CI/CD pipeline automated processes including testing, building, pushing Docker images to ECR, and deploying the application on EC2, promoting a continuous deployment strategy. Langchain’s framework was instrumental in managing prompt chaining, maintaining contextual conversations, and supporting complex dialogue flows. The RAG approach combined with Pinecone’s vector search ensured that responses were not only generated but also rooted in reliable medical sources. The holistic use of cloud services, automation tools, and AI technologies led to the development of a robust, scalable, and secure medical chatbot capable of enhancing patient engagement and supporting healthcare professionals.
